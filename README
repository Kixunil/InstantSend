Instant Send - simplified
Version: 0.4
Author: Martin Habov≈°tiak

Features:
	Server loads configuration
	Server uses multithreading - one thread for each server plugin and connected client
	Client can send file(s), targets are in its configuration file
	Both client and server use Json for handling communication and config files
	You can create any imaginable plugin for communication
	Plugins can use another plugins. This means you can chain them or add features without changing original plugin.
	Server implements some events and uses event plugins
	Experimental version of gtk-widget can show receiving files

Issues:
	Several things are hard coded
	No authentication is used
	No integrity checking
	Resuming of sending is not implemented
	Only POSIX systems (maybe only Linux) are supported
	GUI is highly experimental

Plugins:
	ip4tcp		- as name suggests, it uses TCP/IP with IPv4
	dbus		- uses dbus for notifying connected applications
	desktop-notify	- uses libnotify for showing desktop notifications
	zenity		- uses zenity for showing progress of downloading

Config files:
	Should be placed in ~/.instantsend/
	Json syntax
	See examples

Work in progress, stay tuned :)

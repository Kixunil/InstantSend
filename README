Instant Send - simplified
Version: 0.2
Author: Martin Habov≈°tiak

Features:
	Server loads configuration
	Server uses multithreading - oone thread for each server plugin and connected client
	Client can send file(s), targets are in its configuration file
	Both client and server use Json for handling communication and config files
	You can create any imaginable plugin for communication

Issues:
	Autotools don't work but it's possible to compile with make -f Makefile.in
	Many things are hard coded
	No authentication is used
	Resuming of sending is not implemented
	Plugins can't use another plugins
	Only POSIX systems (maybe only Linux) are supported

Plugins:
	ip4tcp - as name suggests, it uses TCP/IP with IPv4

Config files:
	Should be placed in ~/.instantsend/
	Json syntax
	See examples

Work in progress, stay tuned :)

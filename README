Instant Send - simplified
Version: 0.8
Author: Martin Habovštiak

Features:
	Client and server use configuration files
	Server uses multithreading - one thread for each server plugin and connected client
	Client can send file(s) and directory (directories), targets are in its configuration file
	Both client and server use Json for handling communication and config files
	You can create any imaginable plugin for communication
	Server implements some events and uses event plugins
	Experimental version of gtk-widget can show receiving files, start/stop server, invoke send command (via buttons, tray iconmenuu or drag&drop); localized
	Caja and Nautilus modules provides comfortable sending from file manager

Issues:
	No integrity checking
	Resuming of sending is not implemented
	Encryption is not usable for average users

Plugins:
	ip4tcp		- as name suggests, it uses TCP/IP with IPv4
	ip6tcp		- same as ip4tcp, except it uses IPv6 (Link local adresses not supported yet)
	dbus		- uses dbus for notifying connected applications
	desktop-notify	- uses libnotify for showing desktop notifications
	zenity		- uses zenity for showing progress of downloading
	avahi-publish	- uses libavahi for publishing service in local network

Scripts:
	instsend-scan	- auto-finds targets
	instsend-cli	- enhancement for CLI
	bash-completion	- provides bash-completion support
	others		- enhace user experience

Config files:
	Should be placed in ~/.instantsend/
	Json syntax
	See examples
